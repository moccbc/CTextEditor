# CTextEditor

## Introduction

### What is it?
This is a command line text editor written in C created by following [this](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) tutorial.

Some of the features I add (and to plan to add) on top of the tutorial are:
    - Vim style movement keys
    - Modal editing
    - Copy and paste
    - Line numbers

### Purpose
The following are the main purposes of undertaking this project:
    - Grasp an understanding of how Vim works under the hood
    - Developing usable software
    - Adding features to an existing codebase

## Installation

### Prerequisites
The c compiler is needed in order to run the program. Below instructions are from Chapter 1: Setup of the tutorial.
    - Windows
      Some kind of Linux environment is needed. See the [installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10?redirectedfrom=MSDN) in order to install Bash on Windows. Then run 'sudo apt-get install gcc make' to install the C compiler and make.
    - MacOS
      Open terminal and run 'xcode-select --install' and click install. This will install a C compiler with make.
    - Linux
      Run 'sudo apt-get install gcc make' in the terminal to install the c compiler and the make program.
